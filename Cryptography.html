    <p>Cryptography involves creating written or generated codes that allow information to be kept secret. Cryptography converts data into a format that is unreadable for an unauthorized user, allowing it to be transmitted without unauthorized entities decoding it back into a readable format, thus compromising the data.If you want to learn what Cryptography is and classic cryptosystems then this page is here to help you learn. It will show you how cryptography works and the different applications of the topic. Study the overview given below with the help of some informative videos. When you feel that you know the material well enough and are ready to start the trivia game then click the TRIVIA tab on the menu above to start the game.</p>

      <h5>How did Cryptography begin?</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Cryptography was first known when they found an inscription carved around 1900 BC, in the main chamber of the tomb of the nobleman Khnumhotep II, in Egypt. The scribe used some unusual hieroglyphic symbols here and there in place of more ordinary ones. They say that the purpose was not to hide the message but perhaps to change its form in a way which would made it appear dignified. Though the inscription was not a form of secret writing, but incorporated some sort of transformation of the original text. This was the oldest known text to do so. Evidence of some use of cryptography has been seen in most major early civilizations.The very word cryptography has Greek origins. “Kryptos” means hidden and “Graphein” – word</p><br>


      <h5>Shift Cipher</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Around 100 BC, Julius Caesar was known to use a form of encryption to convey secret messages to his army generals posted in the war front. This is one of the earliest known and simplest ciphers.It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 2, A would be replaced by C, B would become D, and so on. <strong><br>Formula:</strong> For each plain text letter, substitute the cipher text letter C: then C = E(3,p)=(p+3) mod 26 <br> A shift may be of any amount, so that general Caesar algorithm is C =E(k,p)=(p+k) mod 26 <br> Where k takes on a value in the range 1 to 25. The decryption algorithm is simply P=D(k,C)=(C-k) mod 26
      </p><br>
      
      <h5>One-Time Pads</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"> The OTP cipher was first described by Frank Miller in 1882, and was re-invented in 1917. In cryptography, a one-time pad is a system in which a private key generated randomly is used only once to encrypt a message that is then decrypted by the receiver using a matching one-time pad and key. Messages encrypted with keys based on randomness have the advantage that there is theoretically no way to "break the code" by analyzing a succession of messages. Each encryption is unique and bears no relation to the next encryption so that some pattern can be detected.<br>
      <strong>Formula:</strong> Encryption: Plaintext + Key = Ciphertext => (m+k) mod 26<br>
      Decryption: M = (c-k+26) mod 26</p><br>
    
      <h5>Affine Ciphers</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">The affine cipher is a type of monoalphabetic substitution cipher, where in each letter in an alphabet is mapped to its numeric equivalent, encrypted using a simple mathematical function, and converted back to a letter. The formula used means that each letter encrypts to one other letter, and back again, meaning the cipher is essentially a standard substitution cipher with a rule governing which letter goes to which. As such, it has the weaknesses of all substitution ciphers. Each letter is enciphered with the function (ax + b) mod 26, where b is the magnitude of the shift.<br>
      <strong>Formula:</strong> Encryption: E(x) = (ax+b)mod m, where modulus m i sthe size of the the alphabet and a and b are the key of the cipher. <br>
      Decryption: D(x) = a<sup>-1</sup>(x-b) mod m, where a<sup>-1</sup> is the modular multiplicative inverse of a modulo m.</p><br>
    
      <h5>The Vigenere Cipher
</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"> In the 16th century, Vigenere designed a cipher that was supposedly the first cipher which used an encryption key.This cipher uses a 26×26 table with A to Z as the row heading and column heading This table is usually referred to as the Vigenère Tableau, Vigenère Table or Vigenère Square. The first row of this table has the 26 English letters. Starting with the second row, each row has the letters shifted to the left one position in a cyclic way. For example, when B is shifted to the first position on the second row, the letter A moves to the end.<br>
      <strong>Formula:</strong> The encryption E using the key K can be written as C = E<sub>k</sub>(M) = (M + K) mod 26 <br>
      Decryption D using key K as M = D<sub>k</sub>(C - K) mod 26</p><br>
    
      <h5>Substitution Ciphers
</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">In cryptography, a substitution cipher is a method of encrypting by which units of plaintext are replaced with ciphertext, according to a fixed system; the "units" may be single letters, pairs of letters, triplets of letters, mixtures of the above, and so forth.</p>
